// Basic page structure is called in simply by typing "rafce". The formula that gets pulled in is as follows:
// import React from 'react'

// const ChannelDetail = () => {
//   return (
//     <div>
//       Channel Detail
//     </div>
//   )
// }

// export default ChannelDetail

// Within the <div> is where we start adding in the elements that will be included within that component (the div will likely get replaced altogether)
